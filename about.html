                    <p>Local Workers enables millions of underprivileged and unorganized blue-collar workers to find local employment, free of cost, directly from nearby employers, without the middlemen in between.
                
                        In turn, the platform makes it easy, quick, reliable & affordable for millions of employers to find & hire nearby blue-collar workers.
                        
                        With a larger vision to end poverty, forced labour, worker exploitation, and human trafficking, Helpers Near Me is working towards creating an ecosystem of inclusive economic growth for India's underprivileged unorganised blue-collar workforce.
                        
                        The platform uses tech-led complex algorithms via its different digital platforms as a medium to establish a direct Employer-Worker connection.
                        
                        Helpers Near Me also works closely with Government bodies and NGOs to help connect the blue-collar workforce with nearby employers.
                        
                        The platform helps in establishing Employer-Worker connections in a fairly organised way. At a local level, it allows both men & women workers to connect directly with nearby Employers.
                        
                        In the long run, having enough local employment opportunities allows workers to find a better working environment and better salaries for themselves and an opportunity to improve their quality of life.</p>

                    <br> <h3>Why should you find & hire Workers from Local Workers?</h3><br>
                    <p>Simple choices affect the world we live in.
                
                        We are flooded with multiple choices for things we consume every day - Which Tea/Coffee? Which Cereal? Which Car? What kind of Fruits & Vegetables? Etc.
                        
                        At times, these simple choices we make every moment affect our environment, planet or a group of individuals or community, directly or indirectly. Or else they are just simple means of earning financial gains.
                        
                        It is okay if an enterprise earns revenues for itself. However, it would be great if financial gains could also impact our world. And therefore, make the world better than what it is.
                        
                        At Helpers Near Me, we believe with the help of technology, it is possible to make an ecosystem which can help millions of blue-collar workforce find local employment opportunities. The ecosystem can sustain itself in the process with a nominal fee. We firmly believe that technology today can impact the lives of millions in multiple ways.
                        
                        With your help, we can make this happen.
                        
                        So, go ahead. Connect with your nearby workers directly, without the middlemen in between. And impact the life of one or a few of whom you can.</p>
